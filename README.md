# fsystem : Lua File System Module

This repository provides a simple Lua module to access system file features using C.
The module includes functionality :
- readdirFile() : Reads file names from the specified directory.
- fileFormat() : Returns the Unix or Windows file format
This is mainly a didactic project and for a personal need, but it can be useful! Do not hesitate...

## Features

- `readdirFile(path)` : Reads file names from the specified directory and returns a Lua table with the names of regular files.
- `fileFormat(pathFile)` : Returns the Unix or Windows file format depending on the end-of-line return. (0 = Indeterminate format or empty, 1 = Unix, 2 = Windows)

## Compilation

To compile the C source code into a shared library (`fsystem.so`), use the following command:

```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2 -o ./fsystem.so ./fsystem.c -I/usr/include/lua5.4 -llua5.4
```

This command will generate the fsystem.so shared object, which can be loaded into Lua.

## Testing

To test the module, you can use the main.lua script. Hereâ€™s an example of how to run it, look at :

```bash
lua main.lua
```

Make sure that fsystem.so is in the same directory or in your package.cpath.

The main.lua script will require the module .so.
